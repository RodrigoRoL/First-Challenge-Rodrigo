# Bootcamp First Challenge
## Description

 The aim of this challenge was to test the newly acquired skills from this bootcamp. Through the first week I learned concepts in HTML and CSS styling. 
 
 The challenge of this week was to refactor a starter code provided by the course under the first challenge for a website. Refactoring this code results in an easy to follow HTML and CSS code while still doing the same actions from the starter code. 

One of the things I learned from this challenge is the semantics of the HTML and how refactor a code.

## Usage

Inside this repository you can find the refactored source code under the name "index.html"
Further, you can find the stylsheet under "stylsheet2.CSS"
In addition, there are multiple images provided to us for this challenge under the "images" folder.
