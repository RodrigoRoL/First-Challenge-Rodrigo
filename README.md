# Bootcamp First Challenge
## Description

- What was your motivation? The aim of this challenge was to test the newly acquired skills from this bootcamp. Through the first week I learned concepts in HTML and CSS styling. The challenge of this week was to refactor a starter code for a website. Refactoring this code results in an easy to follow HTML and CSS code while still doing the same actions from the starter code. 

One of the things I learned from this challenge is the semantics of the HTML and how refactor a code.
